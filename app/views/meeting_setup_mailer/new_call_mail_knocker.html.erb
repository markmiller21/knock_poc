Hi <%=@knocker.display_name%>,<br/><br/>

<p>Your knock has been sent! Weâ€™ll send a confirmation for your call when <%=@knockee.display_name%> accepts.</p>
<br/>
<% if @meeting.meeting_type == Constants::CALL_TYPE %>
    <p> Knock will automatically call your phone at your scheduled time. </p>
<%else%>
    <p> Please remember to attend the meeting with your knockee :) </p>
<%end%>

<br/>
<p>Remember, the first three minutes are granted free, and your call will last as long as you'd like. </p>

<p>Happy Knocking!</p>
